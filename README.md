# Abelian-Sandpile
This program implements the Abelian Sandpile. This it is shown in a 23x23 plane.  If one of the cells exceeds 8 then it will add a grain of sand to its other 8 neighbors. This process was mainly incorporated through 2d arrays. The program also incorporates sinks. These sinks are essentially a place where sand does not accumulate. The program can also update the sandpile depending on your inputted fps. The output is shown through the command line.
